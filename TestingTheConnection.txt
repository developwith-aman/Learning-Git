#Git Stash ↓
#If we make changes in a branch and then try switching to another branch without committing the changes,
#then in this case we will not be allowed to do so. But what if we don't want to commit the changes and
#just switching the branch for any reason, then in this case we can use "Stash" (git stash).
#For regaining the content written before doing stash, we use "git stash apply".
#For Applying and Dropping the stash at the same time, we use "git stash pop".
